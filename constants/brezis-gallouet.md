# Brezis–Gallouet–Wainger remainder constant on the 2D torus

## Description of constant

Let $\mathbb T^2 = (\mathbb R / 2\pi\mathbb Z)^2$ and let $u \in H^2(\mathbb T^2)$ with zero mean.
Define the frequency ratio
$$
\delta(u) := \frac{\|\Delta u\|_{L^2(\mathbb T^2)}^2}{\|\nabla u\|_{L^2(\mathbb T^2)}^2}.
$$

The sharp Brezis–Gallouet inequality on the 2D torus takes the form
$$
\|u\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb T^2)}^2 \le \frac{1}{4\pi}\,\|\nabla u\|_{L^2(\mathbb T^2)}^2
\Bigl[\ln\delta(u) + \ln\bigl(1+\ln\delta(u)\bigr) + L\Bigr]
$$
where the leading coefficient $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ is sharp (cannot be reduced).

The constant $C_N = L$ is the **optimal additive remainder**: the infimum over all $L$ such that the above inequality holds for all admissible $u$ with $\delta(u) > 1$. Equivalently, $L$ is defined via the constrained extremal problem
$$
L = \max_{\delta \geq 1} \left[ 4\pi\Theta(\delta) - \ln\delta - \ln(1+\ln\delta) \right]
$$
where $\Theta(\delta) := \sup\bigl\{|u(0)|^2 : \|{\nabla u}\|_2^2 = 1,\, \|\Delta u\|_2^2 = \delta\bigr\}$.

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| $L \approx 2.15627$ | [BDZ2013] | Numerical evaluation; maximum achieved at $\delta^* \approx 3.92888$ |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| $L > \frac{\beta + \pi}{\pi} \approx 1.82283$ | [BDZ2013] | Rigorous; follows from asymptotic analysis showing the inequality fails at $L = L_\infty$ |

Here $\beta = \pi(2\gamma + 2\log 2 + 3\log\pi - 4\log\Gamma(1/4))$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

## Additional comments

- The leading coefficient $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ in front of the logarithmic terms is completely determined; the remaining optimization is entirely in the additive constant $L$.
- The simpler "one-log" Brezis–Gallouet inequality $\|u\|_\infty^2 \le C\|\nabla u\|_2^2(\ln\delta + K)$ has infimum $C = \frac{1}{4\pi}$, but this infimum is **not attained** with any finite $K$—the log-log correction is necessary.
- The constant $L$ is expressed in terms of lattice sums over $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and does not have a known closed form.
- The maximum in the variational definition is unique and achieved at finite $\delta^*$; the corresponding conditional extremal $u_{\mu(\delta^*)}(x)$ is an exact extremal function.
- Applications include sharp attractor dimension bounds for 2D Navier–Stokes equations on the torus.
