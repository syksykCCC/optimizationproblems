Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley Constant ($C_{11}$)
Description

$C_{11}$ (often denoted $\beta_2$ in literature) is the Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley (BHH) constant for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem (TSP) in the plane. It defines the asymptotic per-point length of the optimal TSP tour through $n$ random points in a unit-area region. In 1959, Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley proved that there exists a universal constant $C_{11}$ such that the length $L_n$ of the shortest tour through $n$ independent uniform random points satisfies $L_n/\sqrt{n}\to C_{11}$ almost surely. They established initial rigorous bounds $0.625 \le C_{11} \le 0.92116$ (approximately). The exact value of $C_{11}$ remains unknown, but extensive computational studies strongly indicate $C_{11}\approx 0.71$. This constant is sometimes called the “TSP constant” for the Euclidean plane, and is one of the fundamental quantities in probabilistic combinatorial optimization.

Known Upper Bounds

The table below summarizes known upper bounds on $C_{11}$ (showing the best proven values over time). Each bound is given with its source and a brief description of the method or improvement.

Upper Bound on $C_{11}$	Source (Year)	Comments
$C_{11} \le 0.92116$ (approx.)	Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley (1959)	Original bound from BHH theorem using a strip-based constructive tour (horizontal slicing argument). BHH’s numerical evaluation of the required integral gave $\approx0.92116$.
$C_{11} < 0.92116$ (improved)	Steinerberger (2015)	Noted a slight improvement by allowing “zigzag” path corrections instead of a purely left-to-right tour. This reduced the bound by an extremely small margin (~$5.6\times10^{-7}$), mainly of theoretical interest.
$C_{11} < 0.90304$	Yu & Carlsson (2023)	Latest computer-aided proof that significantly lowers the upper bound. Uses numerical integration and search over tour patterns to establish $C_{11} < 0.90304$. This approach is amenable to further improvement with more computational power.
Known Lower Bounds

The table below summarizes lower bounds on $C_{11}$, including both rigorous results and heuristic estimates (marked as such). Rigorous bounds guarantee that $C_{11}$ is at least the given value, while heuristic estimates come from simulations or relaxations and suggest likely values of $C_{11}$.

Lower Bound on $C_{11}$	Source (Year)	Comments
$C_{11} \ge 0.625$	Beardwood–Halton–Hammersley (1959)	Original rigorous lower bound. Obtained by subadditivity and geometric arguments ensuring a minimum tour length contribution per point.
$C_{11} \ge 0.6277$	Gaudio & Jaillet (2020)	Improved rigorous lower bound using an approach based on nearest-neighbor distances. By correcting and tightening a prior argument of Steinerberger, they showed a strictly larger bound of 0.6277.
$C_{11} \approx 0.71$ (empirical)	Johnson, McGeoch & Rothberg (1996); Cook et al. (2012)	Heuristic estimate from Monte Carlo simulations and large-scale TSP solves. Extensive experiments (using the Held–Karp relaxation and exact solvers) indicate that $C_{11}$ is about 0.71 to three significant figures.
Additional Comments

Upper bound techniques: The upper bounds on $C_{11}$ come from constructive tour algorithms and refined analyses. The BHH upper bound used a divide-and-conquer strategy, partitioning the unit square into narrow horizontal strips and constructing a tour by connecting points strip-by-strip. This yields an integral expression for the expected tour length; evaluating that integral gave the original $0.92116$ bound. Steinerberger (2015) observed that the BHH strategy (which effectively connects points in each strip in left-to-right order) can be slightly improved by occasional “zigzag” connections. He identified a specific point configuration where a non-monotonic order yields a shorter path, and estimated the probability of this configuration to adjust the bound. The improvement was numerically tiny (on the order of $10^{-7}$), underscoring that it was the conceptual advance that a strictly shorter strategy exists, rather than a meaningful numeric change. Most recently, Yu and Carlsson (2023) introduced a computer-assisted proof that greatly improves the upper bound. Their method combines high-dimensional numerical integration, search over possible tour structures (via decision trees), and rigorous error bounding to show $C_{11}<0.90304$. Notably, their framework is limited only by computational resources and could further tighten the bound with more computing time. An open-source implementation of their algorithm is available, enabling verification and future refinement.

Lower bound techniques: Lower bounds on $C_{11}$ are proven by ensuring any tour must incur a certain minimum length. BHH’s original lower bound of $0.625$ was obtained by a simple but clever geometric argument: intuitively, if we divide the area into small cells, the salesman must travel a certain minimal distance to “visit” points in separate regions, and on average this gives a total length proportional to $0.625\sqrt{n}$. Improving on this took over 50 years – partly because one must rule out all possible short cuts a tour could take. Steinerberger in 2015 proposed a refined analysis using nearest-neighbor distances: for example, if three points are very close to each other, a TSP tour cannot simply connect them in a short triangle without eventually incurring extra length to rejoin the rest of the tour. By quantifying such configurations, he claimed a slight increase over 0.625; however, a flaw was found in that argument. Gaudio & Jaillet (2020) built on the same idea but corrected the analysis, rigorously establishing $C_{11}\ge 0.6277$. Their proof adds a small positive term to the 0.625 bound by accounting for those occasional configurations where the tour is forced to be longer than a naive nearest-neighbor tour would suggest.

Empirical studies and resources: Because $C_{11}$ is difficult to pin down analytically, researchers have turned to simulations and large-scale optimizations to estimate its value. Johnson, McGeoch & Rothberg (1996) used the Held–Karp relaxation (an LP lower bound for TSP) on random point sets of increasing size, and observed the normalized tour length approaching about 0.71. Later, Cook and collaborators solved hundreds of thousands of random TSP instances exactly using the Concorde TSP solver, and their results strongly suggest $C_{11}\approx0.712$. These experiments give confidence in the true value of $C_{11}$, even though they are not rigorous proofs. Researchers have also developed specialized algorithms to approximate the TSP on random points – for example, there are efficient implementations of the Held–Karp bound for large $n$ – to aid in these estimates. For those interested in computational exploration, the Concorde TSP solver is freely available and can solve large Euclidean instances to optimality, and Yu (2023) has made the code for the 0.90304 upper bound proof available on GitHub. These tools provide a practical way to experiment with random TSP instances and further investigate the properties of $C_{11}$.
