# The degree--sensitivity exponent

## Description of constant

Let $f$ be a Boolean function on $n$ bits, i.e. $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ with $n\ge 2$.
For $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and $1\le i\le n$, let $x^{(i)}$ be $x$ with the $i$-th bit flipped.

The (pointwise) sensitivity of $f$ at $x$ is

$$
s(f)(x):=\sum_{i=1}^n |f(x)-f(x^{(i)})|,
$$

and the (max) sensitivity is

$$
s(f):=\max_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} s(f)(x).
$$

Let $\deg(f)$ be the degree of the unique multilinear polynomial over $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that agrees with $f$ on $\{0,1\}^n$.

Define the **degree--sensitivity exponent**

$$
C_{37}:=\sup \frac{\log \ (s(f))}{\log \(\deg(f))},
$$

where the supremum ranges over all $n\geq 2$ and all Boolean functions $f : \{0,1\}^{n} \to \{0,1\}$ with $\deg(f)>1$.

Equivalently, $C_{37}$ is the supremum over exponents $\alpha>0$ such that there exists a Boolean function $f$ of degree at least 2  with

$$
s(f)\ge (\deg(f))^{\alpha}.
$$

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $2$ | [NS1994], [T2013] | One has $s(f)\le bs(f)$ and $bs(f)\le O(\deg(f)^2)$, giving an exponent upper bound $C_{36}\le 2$. |
| $2$ | [P2021] | Improves the *constant factor* in the quadratic bound: $bs(f)\le \deg(f)^2/(\sqrt{10}-2)$, hence $s(f)\le \deg(f)^2/(\sqrt{10}-2)\approx 0.8604\,\deg(f)^2$ (still exponent $2$). |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $1$ | Trivial | Parity on $n$ bits has $s(f)=n$ and $\deg(f)=n$. |
| $\log_2 3 \approx 1.58496$ | [BdW2002], [T2013] | Earlier explicit separation (pre-Kushilevitz)|
| $\log_3 6 \approx 1.63093$ | [HKP2011] | Kushilevitz base function $h$ on $6$ bits has $s(h)=6$ and $\deg(h)=3$. Composing $h$ with itself $k$ times yields a family with $s=6^k$ and $\deg=3^k$, hence exponent $\log_3 6$. |

## Additional comments and links

- The best known **explicit** exponent separating sensitivity from degree is currently $\log_3 6$ (the “Kushilevitz barrier”). Improving this exponent is an open problem.  “Kushilevitz function” was introduced (unpublished by Kushilevitz) in **Footnote 1 of Nisan and Wigderson’s paper** [NW95].

- (Kushilevitz base.) One explicit polynomial representing the base function $h:\{0,1\}^6\to\{0,1\}$ is

$h(z_1,\dots,z_6)=\sum_{i=1}^6 z_i - \sum_{1\le i<j\le 6} z_i z_j + (z_1z_3z_4 + z_1z_2z_5 + z_1z_4z_5 + z_2z_3z_4 + z_2z_3z_5 + z_1z_2z_6 + z_1z_3z_6 + z_2z_4z_6 + z_3z_5z_6 + z_4z_5z_6),$
  
  which is Boolean on $\{0,1\}^6$, has degree $3$, and is fully sensitive at $(0,0,0,0,0,0)$.


-  Before Kushilevitz’s 6-variable base (giving exponent $\log_3 6$), a simpler 3-variable base already yields exponent $\log_2 3$ via self-composition. One concrete choice is the "not-all-equal" function on 3 bits,

$g(x_1,x_2,x_3)=x_1+x_2+x_3-x_1x_2-x_1x_3-x_2x_3,$

   which is Boolean on the cube, has $\deg(g)=2$, and has full sensitivity $s(g)=3$ at $(0,0,0)$. Composing $g$ with itself $k$ times multiplies degree and (pointwise) sensitivity at $0$, yielding $s=3^k$, $\deg=2^k$.
