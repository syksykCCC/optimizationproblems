# Erdős minimum overlap constant

## Description of constant

$C_2$ is the largest constant for which one has
$$
 \sup_{x \in [-2,2]} \int_{-1}^1 f(t) g(x+t)\ dt\geq C_2
$$
for all non-negative $f,g: [-1,1] \to [0,1]$ with $f+g=1$ on $[-1,1]$ and $\int_\mathbb{R} f = 1$, where we extend $f,g$ by zero outside of $[-1,1]$.

## Additional comments and links

- The problem of determining $C_2$ is [Erdős problem #36](https://www.erdosproblems.com/36).  That is to say, $C_2$ is known [H2016] to also be largest constant such that, whenever $N$ is large and $\{1,\dots,2N\}$ is partitioned into two equal subsets $A,B$, then there is an $x$ such that there are $\geq (C_2 - o(1))N$ solutions to $a-b=x$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
