# Tight knot constant

## Description of constant
For a knot (or link) that can be represented as a diagram with a minimum of $C$ crossings, the ropelength is the infimum over all embeddings of the knot (or link) of the ratio of the contour length of the knot to its thickness. The thickness is defined as the radius of the smallest circle that passes through any three points on the knot (where colinear points yield an infinite radius). Colloquially, the ropelength is the least amount of rope required to tie a specific knot in a rope of unit radius. See Cantarella 2002 for full definition.

It is known that the ropelength of any knot is bound below by a three-quarter power of the crossing number, and there is exists a constant $\alpha$ such that $L\geq\alpha C^{3/4}$ but this constant is precisely known. 

Note that there is also a convention where the ropelength is defined relative to a unit-diameter rope, but unit-radius is more common.


## Known upper bounds
Upper bounds are typically found by finding a tight instance of a specific knot using gradient descent (usually a torus knot).
| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| 12.81| Stasiak 1998 | $8_{19}$ knot |
| 12.63| Ashton 2011 | $10_{124}$ knot |
| 10.76| Klotz 2021 | $T(25,26)$ knot |

Results should be arranged in chronological order, and can include bounds that are inferior to the previous bounds.

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
|0.418 | Diao 1998 | Based on lattice embeddings.
| $\left(\frac{4\pi}{11}\right)^{3/4}\approx 1.105$ | Buck 1999 | Argument based on an "electromagnetic" knot energy. The 11 in the denominator can be replaced by 10.67, bringing the bound to 1.13, but it is always reported as 11. |


## Additional comments

Conjectured lower bound of 3.22 (Klotz 2025) based on Mobius energy argument. For knots without asymptotically large $C$ (currently below 1850) a stronger bound exists (Diao 2003).  Alternating knots have a linear lower bound, discussed in 23b.
