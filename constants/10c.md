# Spencer discrepancy constant (“six standard deviations suffice”)

## Description of constant

$C_{10c}$ is the least constant $K$ for which one has
$$\mathrm{disc}(A) \le K\sqrt{n}\qquad\text{for all }n\text{ and all }A\in[-1,1]^{n\times n}.
$$
for all $n\ge 1$ and all real $n\times n$ matrices $A$ with entries bounded in magnitude by $1$, where the **discrepancy** $\mathrm{disc}(A)$ is defined as
$$\mathrm{disc}(A) \;:=\; \min_{x\in\{\pm 1\}^n}\ \|Ax\|_\infty.$$
Equivalently, if $L_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j$ are $n$ linear forms,
then
$$\mathrm{disc}((a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n)=\min_{\varepsilon\in\{\pm 1\}^n}\max_{1\le i\le n}|L_i(\varepsilon)|.$$


## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| $5.32$ | [Spe1985] | Usually reported as $6$. The celebrated “six standard deviations suffice” theorem of Spencer; also applies to rectangular matrices or set systems. |
| $5.199$ | [Bel2013] | Re-optimizes Spencer’s method. |
| $3.65$ (unpublished) | Schmidt [Bel2013] | Unpublished. |
| $3\sqrt{3/2}\approx 3.674235$ | [PV2022] | Also gives an algorithmic version. |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| $1$ | Trivial | $A=[1]$. Also achieved by Hadamard matrices [Band2024] |
| $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414214$ | [Band2024] | $\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\[2pt]1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ has $\mathrm{disc}(A)=2$. |

## Further remarks

- For large $n$, the best asymptotic lower bound remains $1$ [Band2024]
- Replacing the entrywise bound $|a_{ij}|\le 1$ by an $\ell_2$-bound on columns
  leads to the Komlós conjecture, which would imply (after scaling) Spencer-type discrepancy bounds.
