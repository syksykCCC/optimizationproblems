# Optimization Constants in Mathematics

A curated collection of optimization constants $C$ in mathematics, often arising from solving a variational problem, or finding the best constant in a functional inequality.  This repository is focused on recording the best known upper and lower bounds on constants that have an active literature, and encourages crowdsourced contributions and updates (see [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute).

- Here is an initial blog post introducing the project: [A crowdsourced repository for optimization constants?](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2026/01/22/a-crowdsourced-repository-for-optimization-constants/), 22 Terence Tao, January 2026.

## List of Constants

We are arbitrarily numbering the constants as $C_1$, $C_2$, etc. based on the order in which the constants were added to the repository.

1. [Sidon set autocorrelation constant](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/constants/1.html)
2. [Erdős minimum overlap constant](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/constants/2.html)
3. [A sum-difference constant](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/constants/3.html)
